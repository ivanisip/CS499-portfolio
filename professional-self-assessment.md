Professional Self-Assessment

Overview
This ePortfolio summarizes my skills and growth across the computer science program. I used my Android Event Tracker artifact to show progress in software design, data handling, and database work.

Strengths demonstrated
- I build complete applications with clear user flows.
- I apply structured updates through incremental improvements.
- I use evidence to show results, including screens and code-focused database work.

Growth areas
- I improved consistency in session handling across screens.
- I improved list behavior using filtering, sorting, and clear empty states.
- I improved database reliability through upgrade handling and indexing.

Program outcomes alignment
- Software design and engineering: stronger structure and reduced duplicated logic.
- Algorithms and data structures: better list operations through search, filters, and sorting.
- Databases: safer queries, schema control, upgrade logic, and performance indexes.
