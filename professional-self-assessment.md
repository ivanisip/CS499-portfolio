# Professional Self-Assessment

I built skills across software design, algorithms, and databases through the Computer Science program. I strengthened those skills by enhancing my Android Event Tracker app and documenting each change in my ePortfolio.

Software design and engineering  
I design features with clear requirements and a simple user flow. In the Event Tracker app, I separated responsibilities across activities, helpers, and the database layer. I used SharedPreferences to store the signed-in user and maintained consistent navigation across screens. I also improved security by keeping internal activities inaccessible outside the app.

Algorithms and data structures  
I apply practical data handling strategies to keep the UI responsive and predictable. In the Event Tracker app, I used stable sorting to control list order and filtering to reduce clutter when users search events. I used simple, readable logic to support user goals such as searching by event name or room and sorting by newest or guest count.

Databases  
I designed a SQLite schema that supports user accounts and event records. I implemented full CRUD for events and used parameterized queries to prevent injection. I added indexes to improve query performance for sorting and filtering. I also added safer upgrade logic so app updates preserve existing data.

Security mindset  
I design for least privilege and safer data handling. I reduced exposure of internal screens, used parameterized queries, and avoided storing readable passwords by using hashing in authentication flows. I added checks to protect password changes and session state during logout.

Professional communication  
I document decisions, tradeoffs, and testing evidence in clear language. Each enhancement includes purpose, changes made, code evidence, and the results observed in the running app. This ePortfolio presents my work in a format that a technical reviewer or hiring manager can scan quickly.

Career focus  
I plan to grow in mobile development and backend systems. This artifact shows end-to-end work across UI, data handling, database design, and security. It also shows that I can improve an existing codebase with targeted changes and provide clear evidence of outcomes.
