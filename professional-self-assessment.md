title: Professional Self-Assessment

I built this ePortfolio around my Android Event Tracker app. I selected this artifact because it shows end to end mobile development, including UI screens, business logic, and a SQLite persistence layer.

Professional goals and values

I am working toward roles in mobile development or software engineering. I want to build apps that stay stable as features grow and users change devices. I value clear requirements, predictable behavior, and secure handling of user data. This program reinforced a disciplined approach to design, testing, and documentation, which improves reliability and reduces rework.

Strengths developed across the program

Collaboration in a team environment  
Across the program, I practiced breaking work into small tasks, tracking progress, and integrating feedback. In project based courses, I worked from rubrics and milestones to plan work in steps, then refined deliverables after review. This workflow mirrors team delivery, where you align on scope, deliver increments, and adjust based on review.

Communicating with stakeholders  
I improved how I gather requirements and explain technical work to nontechnical audiences. At work, I ran a survey with the events team to understand what they would need from an event tracking app. I used the results to prioritize core workflows such as creating events, viewing event details, and keeping lists easy to search and sort. In this ePortfolio, I apply the same approach by tying each enhancement to a user need and backing it with screenshots and code evidence.

Data structures and algorithms  
I improved my ability to select structures and logic that support consistent behavior. In this artifact, I improved the event list experience by applying predictable sorting and filters, then validating inputs to prevent bad data from reaching later screens. These changes reduce user error, reduce debugging time, and improve usability.

Software engineering and databases  
I strengthened my ability to organize code and protect maintainability. In this artifact, I kept responsibilities separated across activities and helper classes, then reduced duplication where repeated logic increased bug risk. In the database layer, I improved schema management by supporting upgrades without deleting user data and improving query performance with indexes.

Security mindset  
The program reinforced secure design habits, including minimizing exposure, validating inputs, and protecting sensitive data. In this artifact, I focused on safer authentication and predictable access patterns by using parameterized queries and tightening flow control around account operations. These steps reduce common risks such as injection style bugs and accidental data exposure.

How the artifacts fit together

This portfolio starts with my code review, which documents the baseline app behavior and the risks I identified. The original artifacts page shows the starting state through screenshots and code context. Each enhancement page explains what I changed, why I changed it, and what skills the change demonstrates. The enhanced artifacts page shows the updated app behavior after the improvements. Together, these sections show a complete workflow from evaluation, to planned enhancements, to implemented changes with evidence.
