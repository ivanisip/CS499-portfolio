I built this ePortfolio around my Android Event Tracker app. I used this artifact because it shows full-stack mobile work across UI, business logic, and a SQLite persistence layer.

Strengths across program outcomes

Software design and engineering  
I structured the app into focused activities and helpers. I improved maintainability by reducing duplicate logic and standardizing shared preferences usage across screens.

Algorithms and data structures  
I improved event list behavior by adding predictable sorting and filtering. I applied clear input validation and consistent formatting to reduce user error and reduce rework in downstream flows.

Databases  
I improved reliability and safety in the SQLite layer. I moved toward stable ordering, added indexes for common queries, and improved upgrade handling to preserve user data during schema changes.

Communication and professionalism  
I documented design decisions, evidence, and outcomes in each enhancement page. I used screenshots and code-level evidence to support each change.
